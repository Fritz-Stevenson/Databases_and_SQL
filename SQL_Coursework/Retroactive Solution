--80 distinct drivers, but no likely suspects.

--It was implausible to me that it would be a driver anyways: an idling car, confused user/employee of keiko corp and the question of access to the facility.

create view suspect_riders

--It was not by the courses standards.


--Another implausible portion of the solution was that it was someone related to the employee. An employee has access to the facility and presumably clearance.
--How would an employee convince there family to steal data from them? either way the answer is accessible through:
