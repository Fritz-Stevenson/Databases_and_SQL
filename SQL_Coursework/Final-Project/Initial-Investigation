--First order of business: understand the data structure of the databases, especially the Movr database containing company information.
--A few databases of import:

-- rides table has the most foreign keys with intersections with the vehicles, users, location histories tables etc.
select * from rides 
limit(10);

--Users is a table which has a name field, key to cross-referencing employees,

select * from users 
limit(10);

--Where the vehicles are going is critical. The perpetrator would have have gone to the Movr headquarters, then presumably gone home or to another place of importance.
--using the vehicle_location_histories, we can check all vehicles which have gone to the hq long,lat within a certain timeframe

SELECT * from vehicle_location_histories
where long between 40.5 and 40.8 
and lat between -74.997 and -74.9968
and date(timestamp) = '2020-06-23';
--however this returns 889 results, a dataset that will need to be filtered further.

--Because the theif must have been an employee (the course stated this at the beginning) I am dumping a table from the Movr_employee database for a join to filter users.

--After importing the employees table, I have selected all the distinct employee names using concat for consisten formatting
select distinct concat(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) as full_name, 
--these fields are necessary for joins
users.id, rides.id as ride_id,
--I included the following fields for possible where comparisons
vlh.long, vlh.lat, vlh.timestamp
from employees as e
--filtering down to users who are also employees
join users on users.name = concat(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name)
--filtering rides where the user.id belongs to an employee
join rides on rides.rider_id = users.id
--and including vehicle location histories for finer grain data attached to these ride ids

join vehicle_location_histories as vlh on vlh.ride_id = rides.id;

/*
*The following constraints for Movr facility locations were too strict and resulted in an empty set
*where (vlh.long between 40.5 and 40.8 and vlh.lat between -74.997 and -74.9968)
*To circumvent this, I searched for any users who were employees who used the service and filtered the results manually
*/

--The results of our search are in, Only one employee used Movr in the area on the 23rd of June 2020: Patricia Melton, our prime suspect:
--Their closest destination was 1 mile from the headquarters but this is a reasonable distance to walk.

Select * from users 
where "name" = 'Patricia Melton';

--Freeze his credit card, get a search warrant for his address and continue the investigation.
--It appears he was not the owner of the vehicle: he may have had an accomplice.

--The owner of the vehicle is Caitlin Mccarthy, who took him on 5 rides that day

--Suspect Information in the required format:

select distinct vehicles.id as vehicle_id, users.name, users.address, status, current_location from vehicles
right join users on users.id = vehicles.owner_id
where vehicles.id = 'dccdf95a-8915-40cb-bbf8-b56ce0fd7c94' or users.name = 'Patricia Melton'
