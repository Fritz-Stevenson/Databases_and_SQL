Task using a wildfire database from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires)
We are wrangling multiple columns across inconsistent data types to display the time from fire discovery to fire containment, in hours.
We are then taking that column and dividing Fire_Size with it to create a custom average burn rate column.
